## RPDB Folders app

The "RPDB Folders" app works the following way:
- you install it on the same device where you are running your Kodi app from
- you add all your movie and series folders individually to the RPDB Folders app
- it will start adding posters and/or backdrops to the movie and series folders directly, which are then inserted into Kodi automatically

The RPDB Folders app can be downloaded from:
- [Desktop downloads (Windows, Linux, MacOS)](https://github.com/RatingPosterDB/rpdb-folders/releases)
