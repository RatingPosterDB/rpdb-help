## RPDB Folders app (recommended)

The "RPDB Folders" app works the following way:
- you install it on the same device where you are running your Emby Server from
- you add all your movie and series folders individually to the RPDB Folders app
- it will start adding posters and/or backdrops to the movie and series folders directly, which are then inserted into Emby automatically

The RPDB Folders app can be downloaded from:
- [Desktop downloads (Windows, Linux, MacOS)](https://github.com/RatingPosterDB/rpdb-folders/releases)
- [Docker](https://github.com/RatingPosterDB/rpdb-folders-docker/blob/main/README.md)

For more details, there is a [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/RatingPosterDB/rpdb-folders/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) and an [Advanced Usage Guide](https://github.com/RatingPosterDB/rpdb-folders/wiki/Advanced-Usage) available for the RPDB Folders app.

## Dedicated RPDB Plugin (less features)

You can also use the dedicated RPDB Plugin for Emby, but it has a lot less features compared to the RPDB Folders app.

To install the RPDB Plugin for Emby, you can follow [this guide](https://github.com/RatingPosterDB/RPDB-Emby-Plugin/blob/main/README.md)
